Sure, I can provide you with a comprehensive list of key elements you'll need to consider when building a to-do list with JavaScript. Here are the key components:

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - Create the basic structure of your HTML file.
   - Include sections for the header, input form, task list, and footer.

2. **CSS Styling:**
   - Style your to-do list for a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
   - Consider using a responsive design for different screen sizes.

3. **Header:**
   - Include a title or heading for your to-do list.
   - Add any additional elements you want in the header, such as icons or buttons.

4. **Task Input Form:**
   - Create an input field for users to add new tasks.
   - Consider adding a button to submit the task.

5. **Task List:**
   - Create a container to display the list of tasks.
   - Each task should have a checkbox for completion status.
   - Display the task text.
   - Add buttons for editing or deleting tasks.

6. **JavaScript:**
   - Use JavaScript to handle user interactions and manipulate the DOM.
   - Add event listeners for form submission and button clicks.
   - Implement functions to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.
   - Use local storage to save and retrieve tasks, so they persist even after a page reload.

7. **Task Object:**
   - Consider creating a JavaScript object to represent each task.
   - Include properties such as task text, completion status, and a unique identifier.

8. **Rendering Tasks:**
   - Write a function to render tasks on the page.
   - Update the task list whenever a new task is added or an existing task is modified.

9. **Event Handling:**
   - Handle events like form submission, button clicks, and checkbox changes.
   - Use event delegation for efficient event handling on dynamic elements.

10. **Editing Tasks:**
    - Allow users to edit the text of existing tasks.
    - Update the task list after editing.

11. **Deleting Tasks:**
    - Implement functionality to delete tasks.
    - Confirm with the user before deleting a task.

12. **Completing Tasks:**
    - Enable users to mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
    - Style completed tasks differently for visual feedback.

13. **Local Storage:**
    - Use `localStorage` to store tasks locally on the user's browser.
    - Load tasks from local storage on page load.

14. **Error Handling:**
    - Consider adding error handling for user input or unexpected situations.

15. **Accessibility:**
    - Ensure your to-do list is accessible, considering users with disabilities.
    - Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

16. **Testing:**
    - Test your to-do list on different browsers to ensure compatibility.
    - Consider using testing frameworks for more extensive testing.

17. **Documentation:**
    - Comment your code for clarity.
    - Write a README file explaining how to use your to-do list.

18. **Optional Features:**
    - Consider adding features like due dates, priority levels, or categories for tasks.
    - Implement filtering or sorting options for tasks.

Remember that this is a comprehensive list, and you may not need all of these elements depending on the complexity of your to-do list application. Feel free to adapt and customize based on your specific requirements.
